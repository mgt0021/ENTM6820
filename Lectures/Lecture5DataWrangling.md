#### Selecting

selects certain columns out of a dataset This isn’t that easy to do in
base R.

``` r
microbiomefungi2 <- select(microbiomefungi, SampleID, Crop, Compartment:Fungicide, richness)
```

#### Filter

essentially the same as subsetting in base R

``` r
head(filter(microbiomefungi2, Treatment == "Conv.")) #head func is just to output first 5 rows for demonstration
```

#### Mutate

Create a new column

``` r
microbiomefungi2$logRich <- log(microbiomefungi2$richness) #add a col in base R

head(mutate(microbiomefungi2, logRich2 = log(richness))) #this does the same thing as adding a col in base R
```

#### Piping

inserts output from one function as input into the next function

``` r
microbiomefungi %>%
  select(SampleID, Crop, Compartment:Fungicide, richness) %>%
  filter(Treatment == "Conv.") %>%
  mutate(logRich2 = log(richness)) %>%
  head()         
```

    ##                                    SampleID Crop Compartment DateSampled
    ## 1 Corn2017LeafObjective2Collection1T1R1CAH2 Corn        Leaf     6/26/17
    ## 2 Corn2017LeafObjective2Collection1T1R1CBA3 Corn        Leaf     6/26/17
    ## 3 Corn2017LeafObjective2Collection1T1R1CCB3 Corn        Leaf     6/26/17
    ## 4 Corn2017LeafObjective2Collection1T1R1FAC3 Corn        Leaf     6/26/17
    ## 5 Corn2017LeafObjective2Collection1T1R1FBD3 Corn        Leaf     6/26/17
    ## 6 Corn2017LeafObjective2Collection1T1R1FCE3 Corn        Leaf     6/26/17
    ##   GrowthStage Treatment Rep Sample Fungicide richness  logRich2
    ## 1          V6     Conv.  R1      A         C        9 2.1972246
    ## 2          V6     Conv.  R1      B         C        6 1.7917595
    ## 3          V6     Conv.  R1      C         C        5 1.6094379
    ## 4          V6     Conv.  R1      A         F        7 1.9459101
    ## 5          V6     Conv.  R1      B         F        4 1.3862944
    ## 6          V6     Conv.  R1      C         F        2 0.6931472

#### Summarise

generate summary stats from our data

``` r
microbiomefungi %>%
  select(SampleID, Crop, Compartment:Fungicide, richness) %>% # selecting columns
  filter(Treatment == "Conv.") %>% # subsetting to only include the conventional treatment
  mutate(logRich = log(richness)) %>% # creating a new column of the log richness
  summarise(Mean.rich = mean(logRich)) # calculating overall mean log richness within the conventionally managed treatment
```

    ##   Mean.rich
    ## 1  2.304395

even more summary stats all at once

``` r
microbiomefungi %>%
  select(SampleID, Crop, Compartment:Fungicide, richness) %>% # selecting columns
  filter(Treatment == "Conv.") %>% # subsetting to only include the conventional treatment
  mutate(logRich = log(richness)) %>% # creating a new column of the log richness
  summarise(Mean.rich = mean(logRich), # calculating the mean richness, stdeviation, and standard error
            n = n(), 
            sd.dev = sd(logRich)) %>%
  mutate(std.err = sd.dev/sqrt(n))
```

    ##   Mean.rich   n    sd.dev   std.err
    ## 1  2.304395 144 0.7024667 0.0585389

#### Group_by

calculate mean, std dev for a group rather than filtering

``` r
microbiomefungi %>%
  select(SampleID, Crop, Compartment:Fungicide, richness) %>% # selecting columns
  group_by(Treatment, Fungicide) %>% # grouping by treatment and fungicide to later calculate summary stats by group (each unique treatment and fungicide combination)
  mutate(logRich = log(richness)) %>% # creating a new column of the log richness
  summarise(Mean.rich = mean(logRich), # calculating the mean richness, stdeviation, and standard error
            n = n(), 
            sd.dev = sd(logRich)) %>%
  mutate(std.err = sd.dev/sqrt(n))
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'Treatment'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

    ## # A tibble: 4 × 6
    ## # Groups:   Treatment [2]
    ##   Treatment Fungicide Mean.rich     n sd.dev std.err
    ##   <chr>     <chr>         <dbl> <int>  <dbl>   <dbl>
    ## 1 Conv.     C              2.53    72  0.635  0.0748
    ## 2 Conv.     F              2.07    72  0.696  0.0820
    ## 3 No-till   C              2.63    72  0.513  0.0604
    ## 4 No-till   F              2.36    71  0.680  0.0807

#### Combine with GGPlot

these functions work well together with ggplot

``` r
microbiomefungi %>%
  select(SampleID, Crop, Compartment:Fungicide, richness) %>% # selecting columns
  group_by(Treatment, Fungicide) %>% # grouping by treatment and fungicide to later calculate summary stats by group
  mutate(logRich = log(richness)) %>% # creating a new column of the log richness
  summarise(Mean.rich = mean(logRich), # calculating the mean richness, stdeviation, and standard error
            n = n(), 
            sd.dev = sd(logRich)) %>%
  mutate(std.err = sd.dev/sqrt(n)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Fungicide, y = Mean.rich)) + # adding in a ggplot
  geom_bar(stat="identity") +
  geom_errorbar( aes(x=Fungicide, ymin=Mean.rich-std.err, ymax=Mean.rich+std.err), width=0.4) +
  theme_minimal() +
  xlab("") +
  ylab("Log Richness") +
  facet_wrap(~Treatment)
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'Treatment'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

#### Joining

combine multiple datasets using a common variable

More info can be found
[here](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/mutate-joins.html)

we can easily do this with the joining functions. They include:

- left_join() - Keep all rows of X and add matching rows from Y. Any
  rows in Y that don’t match X are excluded.
- right_join() - reverse of left_join() -inner_join() - only keep rows
  that are common to both X AND Y, remove everything else.
- full_join() - Keep any columns that are in either X or Y

First, lets split the data into taxonomy and metadata.

``` r
# selecting just the richness and sample ID
richness <- microbiomefungi %>%
  select(SampleID, richness)

# selecting columns that don't include the richness
metadata <- microbiomefungi %>% 
  select(SampleID, Fungicide, Crop, Compartment, GrowthStage, Treatment, Rep, Sample)

head(richness)
```

    ##                                    SampleID richness
    ## 1 Corn2017LeafObjective2Collection1T1R1CAH2        9
    ## 2 Corn2017LeafObjective2Collection1T1R1CBA3        6
    ## 3 Corn2017LeafObjective2Collection1T1R1CCB3        5
    ## 4 Corn2017LeafObjective2Collection1T1R1FAC3        7
    ## 5 Corn2017LeafObjective2Collection1T1R1FBD3        4
    ## 6 Corn2017LeafObjective2Collection1T1R1FCE3        2

``` r
head(metadata)
```

    ##                                    SampleID Fungicide Crop Compartment
    ## 1 Corn2017LeafObjective2Collection1T1R1CAH2         C Corn        Leaf
    ## 2 Corn2017LeafObjective2Collection1T1R1CBA3         C Corn        Leaf
    ## 3 Corn2017LeafObjective2Collection1T1R1CCB3         C Corn        Leaf
    ## 4 Corn2017LeafObjective2Collection1T1R1FAC3         F Corn        Leaf
    ## 5 Corn2017LeafObjective2Collection1T1R1FBD3         F Corn        Leaf
    ## 6 Corn2017LeafObjective2Collection1T1R1FCE3         F Corn        Leaf
    ##   GrowthStage Treatment Rep Sample
    ## 1          V6     Conv.  R1      A
    ## 2          V6     Conv.  R1      B
    ## 3          V6     Conv.  R1      C
    ## 4          V6     Conv.  R1      A
    ## 5          V6     Conv.  R1      B
    ## 6          V6     Conv.  R1      C

left join

- “by” is what the datasets have in common, the col they are joined by

``` r
head(left_join(metadata, richness, by = "SampleID")) # adding the richness data to the metadata based on on the common column of sampleID
```

    ##                                    SampleID Fungicide Crop Compartment
    ## 1 Corn2017LeafObjective2Collection1T1R1CAH2         C Corn        Leaf
    ## 2 Corn2017LeafObjective2Collection1T1R1CBA3         C Corn        Leaf
    ## 3 Corn2017LeafObjective2Collection1T1R1CCB3         C Corn        Leaf
    ## 4 Corn2017LeafObjective2Collection1T1R1FAC3         F Corn        Leaf
    ## 5 Corn2017LeafObjective2Collection1T1R1FBD3         F Corn        Leaf
    ## 6 Corn2017LeafObjective2Collection1T1R1FCE3         F Corn        Leaf
    ##   GrowthStage Treatment Rep Sample richness
    ## 1          V6     Conv.  R1      A        9
    ## 2          V6     Conv.  R1      B        6
    ## 3          V6     Conv.  R1      C        5
    ## 4          V6     Conv.  R1      A        7
    ## 5          V6     Conv.  R1      B        4
    ## 6          V6     Conv.  R1      C        2

#### Pivoting

converting dataset from wide to long view Wide data can be useful, but
long is usually better for analysis

More info can be found here:
<https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/pivot_wider.html>

output in long format

``` r
microbiomefungi %>%
  select(SampleID, Crop, Compartment:Fungicide, richness) %>% 
  group_by(Treatment, Fungicide) %>% # grouping by treatment and fungicide to later calculate summary stats by group
  summarise(Mean = mean(richness)) # calculates the mean per Treatment and Fungicide 
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'Treatment'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

    ## # A tibble: 4 × 3
    ## # Groups:   Treatment [2]
    ##   Treatment Fungicide  Mean
    ##   <chr>     <chr>     <dbl>

pivot wider - the data is in wide format now

``` r
microbiomefungi %>%
  select(SampleID, Crop, Compartment:Fungicide, richness) %>% # selecting columns  filter(Class == "Sordariomycetes") %>%
  group_by(Treatment, Fungicide) %>% # grouping by treatment and fungicide to later calculate summary stats by group
  summarise(Mean = mean(richness)) %>% # calculates the mean per Treatment and Fungicide 
  pivot_wider(names_from = Fungicide, values_from = Mean) # pivot to wide format
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'Treatment'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

    ## # A tibble: 2 × 3
    ## # Groups:   Treatment [2]
    ##   Treatment     C     F
    ##   <chr>     <dbl> <dbl>
    ## 1 Conv.      14.6  9.75
    ## 2 No-till    15.4 13.1

names_from: converts the values from that column into new column headers

Can use this to easily take the difference between means of control and
fungicide treatments

``` r
microbiomefungi %>%
  select(SampleID, Crop, Compartment:Fungicide, richness) %>% # selecting columns  
  group_by(Treatment, Fungicide) %>% # grouping by treatment and fungicide to later calculate summary stats by group
  summarise(Mean = mean(richness)) %>% # calculates the mean per Treatment and Fungicide 
  pivot_wider(names_from = Fungicide, values_from = Mean) %>% # pivot to wide format
  mutate(diff.fungicide = C - F) %>%  # calculate the difference between the means. 
  ggplot(aes(x = Treatment, y = diff.fungicide)) + # Plot it 
  geom_col() +
  theme_minimal() +
  xlab("") +
  ylab("Difference in average species richness")
```
